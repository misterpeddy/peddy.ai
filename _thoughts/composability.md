title: The Rise of Composable Content

## Traditional Content Platforms

Content creation is an extremely important part of entertainment, business and labor markets.
Youtube, Reddit, Medium, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are all products that are built upon the premise of giving billions of users some fairly basic tools, a large addressible audience and letting them unleash their creativity to capture the attention of that audience. That attention of course is and will continue to be an extremely important commodity, discussed [here](/preprint/attention).

Through the rise of extremely sophisticated and personalized recommendation engines, these platforms have been able to create extremely dynamic environments where new and old content are constantly fighting one-another for viewership. In order to ensure users come back to the product as frequently as possible, these recommendation engines (or feeds) are tuned to value recency in major ways. This creates an einvironment in which pieces of content surge to extreme levels of popularity, enjoy a relatively short-lived moment under the spotlight, and go back to a baseline level of exposure. Some products take this radicalization to an extreme (90+% of all Instagram comments are left within the first X days of the post) while others (Youtube) have specific parts of the experience that values recency much more than others.

Because most producers on these platforms are also consumers, often times, a class of content (tied together via topicality, pointers to current events, pop-culture references or some other means) surge in popularity and fuel each other's growth. Different platforms implement this functionality differently but some notion of virality of a topic, event, idea, place, or entity appearing in content is surfaced to users somehow: Twitter has highlights, Youtube has Trending, Instagram has Discover, Facebook has Top Stories and Top News. The issue with these viral cohorts of content is that they are often short-lived and isolated from other viral cohorts of content, which forces them to have relatively short shelf-lives.


## TikTok: Composable Content

There has been a lot of buzz around TikTok, with a lot of experienced product people trying to explain its success and speculate about its future. While I don't feel qualified to judge the product's user experience and underlying design system, I have very strong opinions on a fundamental way that it is unlike most other major content platforms. 

On TikTok, instead of being created from scratch, most content is created by composing already-existing posts.

At a mechanical feature-spec level, in creating a post, a user can create original audio, video, texts and effects; but more importantly, they can tap into a complete collection of almost all TikToks ever created, leveraging bits or all of their video, audio, theme, texts, format, references, and many more increasingly abstract components. 

This allows users to easily mix and match and build on top of the work of others. While at the surface this looks simply like a product feature, if we look back at the dynamics model of popularity of content across these platforms, we see why this is an incredibly important distinction.

The users' ability to easily compose (build on top of) other content means that TikTok trends (popular songs, eemixes, sound-bites, chroerographies, formats, scenarios, references) are no longer isolated. Each trend will enjoy being in the spotlight in its own right, but then will be built upon by many other trends, allowing it to live both on its own, and through other related trends much longer than it would have on a platform where composability is not as trivial.

In fact it means that there are no more well-defined viral topics, each distinct from the next. For every successful viral trend, there will be many attempts to build a trend on top of it. Most will fail, but a few will succeed. Some of those derived trends will be so alike the original trend that we could label them the same thing, making it extremely difficult to reason about trend boundaries.

This ability causes successful trends to snowball into others and live on for much longer than they would have been able to on their own. In addition, due to the longevity with which users are exposed to (elements of) any given trend, they have a much higher likelihood of having lasting material impact on our collective culture beyond the confines of the platform.
