title: Life Manifesto

Note: The rationale behind publicly sharing this piece is the first pillar of the manifesto.

* Your most prized asset is your small, internally consistent, publicly shareable set of values. Words, actions, decisions can be altered at runtime as desired, but over the long run, they will out your values. So ensure you're content with how your internal values evolve and would not mind if they were revealed to the world (because in time, they will).

* Mathematics is your only language. If you cannot express an idea mathematically, do not claim to understand it.

* Incentives drive behavior. Do not manage, control, or manipulate - design the right incentive structure and let the desired outcome flow. 

* Make people smile. Your brain likes seeing other humans happy.

* If you feel the need to prove to someone you're good at something, you need to become better at it.

* People are fickle. Never be critically dependent on a single person or a single group of people.

* Never kill someone's excitement no matter how misguided they are. Help them re-channel it or do nothing at all.

* Most non-males have gone through types of pain for which you have no analog. Be kind, seek to understand let them teach you to empathize.

* Protect your ground truth (values) and ensure total consistency within it. All other (seconadry) beliefs should be easily mutable at runtime when presented with new evidence.
