Hello. My name is Pedram and this is my personal blog. I use this corner of the internet to jot down my thoughts, articulate my views on topics that interest me and document my jounrey through the space of ideas.

As of mid 2019, I'm working in Google Brain on systems for machine learning. As a part of my job, I spend a lot of time researching and building [large-scale](http://stevenwhang.com/tfx_paper.pdf), [open-source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) software systems that allow others to design and build [software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35). On a slightly higher level, I help our teams within Brain inform their research agenda through deep engagements with product teams across Alphabet. My team's scope of research and development is roughly aligned with the inference phase of the machine learning development workflow (in contrast with training).

Outside of my work, I spend most of my time thinking about the following:

* [People](/tags/people.html): The reasons behind why people act the way they do

* [Technology](/tags/technology.html): The top k most impactful technologies, and how they will evolve alongside humanity

* [Product](/tags/product.html): The bridge between problems and solutions, humans and technology, ...

* [Math](/tags/math.html): The beautiful land of the abstract, far far away from the nasty idiosyncrasies of nature 

* [Machine Learning](/tags/ml.html): Thoughts on the science behind and practice of building learning systems

* [Music](/tags/music.html): The only constant in my life since I was 4 years old, a never-ending source of happiness


Since beginning of 2019, [peddy.ai](http://peddy.ai) has been my home on the internet. In addition to this blog ([blog.peddy.ai](http://blog.peddy.ai)), it mirrors my private git server ([git.peddy.ai](http://git.peddy.ai)), exposes my private Kubernetes cluster's API Server ([k8s.peddy.ai](http://k8s.peddy.ai)), hosts my public and private datasets ([data.peddy.ai](http://data.peddy.ai)), is a gateway to my home LAN ([home.peddy.ai](http://home.peddy.ai)), and more. 

Unsurprisingly, most neighborhoods within this domain are restricted and [should be] unreachable without proper credentials. While not a security expert by any means, I've spent a great deal of time designing the security posture of this tiny part of the interwebs that I control. If you're interested in network security (and a nice person :)), please feel free to snoop around and let me know if I have left any backdoors open.


If any of the content on this site interests you, please feel free to [reach out](/contact/) to me - I have many thoughts and far too few people to share them with :)
