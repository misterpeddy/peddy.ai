I think about product and how one should approach product development a lot - I will use this post as a means of trying to distill my thoughts into (somewhat) comprehendible string of words. 

The most important thing I’ve learned about product is that most ideas are of the form “if we do X, then Y can do Z” are wrong. They may seem valuable, useful, doable, etc. at first, but after varying degrees of investigation, one by one, they fall apart.

However, a few of these ideas actually have the potential of being valuable (net positive in some sense) but they will take a number of iterations to reach that potential. Your job as a PM is to identify the potentially net positive ideas, and as quickly and cheaply as possible evolve them to reach that potential.

Generally, an idea is centered around a problem, with an opinionated way of solving it. For any idea, you should assess the following:

1. Value of the problem: Is this solving a real, important problem?
2. Usability of solution: Is our solution what users want to use to solve the problem?
3. Feasibility of solution: Can we reasonably build and support the solution?
4. Viability of problem and solution: Can we build a sustainable business around offering the solution to this problem

Most PMs focus on a subset of this list: if you’re a technical PM, you probably care about #1 and #3, a design-oriented PM (eg. product excellence PMs) will focus on #2 and a market-oriented PM will likely be consumed by #1 and #4. 

So how do we answer these questions? Validation.

As a PM, your expertise is in having a deep, validated understanding of the customer, the market and the business. This means you understand exactly why your users love and hate you, why your succeeding or failing in the market, and why investors should or should not trust in your future. 

# Terminology
A product roadmap is a validated, prioritized list of features and projects to be delivered
A product strategy is a validated sequence of releases or products that delivers on a product vision. The factors that matter most to product strategy are TAM (Total Addressable Market), TTM (Time-to-Market) and GTM (Go-to-Market)

# Discovery and Validation

A large part of product management is learning idiosyncratic facts about your target audience, their world and their specific problem of interest. This is done through having concrete hypotheses, and using discovery processes to validate (or more commonly invalidate) them.
